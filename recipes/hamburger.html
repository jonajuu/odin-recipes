    <h1> Hamburger</h1>
    <img src="../img/burger.jpg">

    <p>Close your eyes, and picture the perfect hamburger.</p>
    <p>Is it a thin diner-style hamburger patty, or a thick steakhouse-sized burger? Seared to the peak of juiciness on
        a grill or in a flat griddle?</p>
    <p>Make burgers your way and have them come out flawless every time with what I consider to be the Best Hamburger
        Patty Recipe, in my humble opinion.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground chuck</li>
        <li>½ cup crushed saltine crackers or Panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set out a large mixing bowl. Add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk,
            salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper. Mix by hand until the meat mixture is smooth, but stop once
            the mixture looks even. (Overmixing can create a dense heavy texture.)</li>

        <li>Press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty
            mixture into 6 – 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle patties.</li>

        <li>Set out a baking sheet, lined with wax paper or foil, to hold the patties. One at a time, gather the patty
            mix and press firmly into patties. Shape them just slightly larger than the buns you plan to use, to account
            for shrinkage during cooking. Set the patties on the baking sheet. Use a spoon to press a dent in the center
            of each patty so they don't puff up as they cook. If you need to stack the patties separate them with a
            sheet of wax paper.</li>

        <li>Preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat. (Approximately 350-400 degrees F.)</li>

        <li>For thick patties: Grill or fry the patties for 3-4 minutes per side.</li>

        <li>For thin patties: Cook on the griddle for 2 minutes per side.</li>

        <li>Stack the hot patties on hamburgers buns, and top with your favorite hamburgers toppings. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>

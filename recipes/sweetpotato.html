    <h1>Baked Sweet Potatoes</h1>
    <img src="../img/sp.jpeg">

    <p>Adding sweet potatoes to your diet is an easy and delicious habit to pick up when you're trying to eat
        healthy—the vegetable is a total superfood, packed with vitamin C and fiber. They're also totally versatile but
        baking them whole in the oven is arguably the simplest way to prepare them, and they will be the perfect base
        for all types of toppings. We love them stuffed with barbecue chicken or as a bunless sloppy joe.</p>
    <p>Check out our easy instructions below for baking the perfect baked sweet potato—because in our opinion, nothing
        beats one topped with a big pat of butter and some salt and pepper.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 sweet potatoes, scrubbed clean</li>
        <li>4 tbsp. butter</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425º. On a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil, prick sweet potatoes all over with a fork.</li>
        <li>Bake until tender, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cool, then split the tops open with a knife and top with a pat of butter.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper before serving.</li>
    </ol>
